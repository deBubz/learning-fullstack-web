# Part 1

> So what have I leaned here

Lets go through each bit

- Server is quite standard
- Controllers is Standard
- Models is standard
- Route is standard, but maybe stream line my routes up abit using the other methods
- the DB is pretty standard as well
- the error handling middleware is nice, maybe ill try to do something similar to this
- `express-async-handler` should be something to also look into
