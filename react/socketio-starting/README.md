# something with socket io

trying something with [socket.io](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/#Introduction)

## Thoughts

seems pretty alright but so far, it just entails node running a plain html page.

> I need to find out how to runthis on **React** front end

lets check its *homework*

- broadcast a message when a user connects/ disconnects
- add support for nicknames
- dont sent the same mesg to the user that sent it. instead append the message directly as soon as they press enter?
  - does this mean let it skip the back end and go straight to front end
- add {user} is typing function
- show who's online
- add private messaging
