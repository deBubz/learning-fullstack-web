# List and conditionals

## handling dynamic content the JS way

- very interesting to assign a variable to `null`
- add a if statement to reassign it
- then passing the variable into the return msg

> prevent mutating array mentioned

## list & keys

- index is bad for keys because if the list changes, id also changes


## some tasks

- [x] create input field with change listener - output entered text under it
- [x] Validation component - recieve text length as prop
- [x] Validation - output Text too short - not long enough
- [x] Char component style as inline box
    ```
    display inline
    padding 16
    text-align center
    margin 16
    border
    ```
- [x] render list of char component where each char recieves a different leter
